          <p>
            I graduated from Belarusian National Technical University. My major
            - Customs Business and I was working as a customs agent. In 2016 I
            moved to the US and here I was wokring in a bread company, also I
            have a side job in e-commerce industry.

          <p>
            All my life I play video games. I started from Atari console and
            then it was Dendy, Sega, Super Nintendo, Playstation. After time my
            father bought me a PC when I was in ninth grade.I was playing in
            Counter-Strike a lot. I had to make an aliases in developer console
            to make my playing easier. For example, instead of pressing 4 keys I
            made a script, when you press one button you could get all
            ammunition and all grenades in Counter-Strike. It saves time and you
            can get a better position. I'm a former professional Counter-Strike
            Player.
          </p>

          <p>
            I want to become a web developer because I like what I'm doing. When
            you get a neat and right result from coding is priceless.
